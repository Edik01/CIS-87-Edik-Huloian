    "Welcome to the interactive world of [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/editing-jupyter-notebook-files.html), which will be your primary tool for coding throughout this course. Jupyter notebooks integrate both code and rich text elements within a single document, allowing for an intuitive workflow that combines explanations, coding, and results analysis. Here, content is divided into blocks called \"cells\" that come in two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Markdown Cells**: Like this one, markdown cells contain text formatted using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), a lightweight markup language. You can use special symbols to create headings, lists, links, and other formatted text. This is ideal for explanations, instructions, or presenting analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Cells**: These cells are where you will actively write and test your Python code. To run the code in a cell, place your cursor inside it and either press `Ctrl + Enter` or click the green \"Run Cell and Select Below\" button above. This interactive execution allows you to immediately see the output of your code, which is crucial for learning and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this environment, you will engage with:\n",
    "- **Examples**: I will provide code examples to illustrate programming concepts.\n",
    "- **Exercises**: These are practice problems for you to solve, enhancing your understanding of the material. While not mandatory, completing these exercises is strongly recommended to maximize your learning.\n",
    "- **Assessments**: These are required tasks that evaluate your grasp of the course content. Completing these will help ensure you have mastered the necessary skills and knowledge.\n",

    "\n",
    "Variables are essential tools in programming, acting as placeholders to store data that can be used and manipulated later in the code. Think of variables as labeled boxes where you can store information. To assign a value to a variable, we use the **assignment operator** (`=`). Here are some examples:\n",

    "\n",
    "When naming variables in Python, there are specific rules and best practices to follow:\n",
    "- **Basic Rules**: Variable names can include letters, numbers, and underscores. However, they must not start with a number. For example, `CIS087` is valid, but `087CIS` is not.\n",
    "- **Case Sensitivity**: Python is case-sensitive, meaning `cis_instructor` and `CIS_instructor` are considered different variables.\n",
    "- **PEP8 Guidelines**: According to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names), Python's official style guide, variable names should be lowercase with words separated by underscores to improve readability. This convention is especially important for maintaining code clarity and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a comprehensive list of reserved words in Python that cannot be used as variable names, refer to the [Official Python Keyword Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords). Using these reserved keywords as variable names will result in syntax errors, as they have predefined meanings in Python's language syntax."

    "\n",
    "In Python, strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotation marks. You can use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`\"`) to define a string. Examples include `\"dog\"`, `'Patrick'`, `\"123 Main St.\"`, and `'Password123!'`. It is important to be consistent with the type of quote used within a single string. Mixing single and double quotes, such as `\"Jeromy'` or `'Hello!\"`, results in syntax errors as they are not valid strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To include an apostrophe within a string, use double quotes to enclose the string, like `\"Won't this work?\"`. To include a quotation mark inside a string, use single quotes, as in `'They said \"Try it!\" so I did.'`\n",

    "The `len()` function in Python is essential for determining the length of data types like strings. The length of a string is the number of characters it contains, including spaces and punctuation. For instance, `len(\"Hello!\")` returns `6`, indicating that `\"Hello!\"` has six characters. The length of an empty string (`\"\"`) is `0`.\n",

    "Concatenation in Python refers to the process of combining strings end-to-end. This is achieved using the concatenation operator (`+`). For example, `\"Hello \" + \"Patrick!\"` results in `\"Hello Patrick!\"`. Concatenation requires values of the same type; thus, trying to combine a string with a number (without converting the number to a string) will result in an error. Concatenation is a fundamental technique for building strings from smaller segments. For instance, `\"A\" + \"part\"` produces the string `\"Apart\"`."

    "## [Section 1.7](https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/1-7-comments): Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "You have seen me use comments in the previous sections. They are a tool that programmers use to give other programmers more insight about \n",
    "\n",
    "### [The hash character](https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/1-7-comments#sect-00002)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, comments are short phrases that explain what the code is doing and are not executed as part of the program. Each comment begins with a hash character (`#`), and all text from the hash character to the end of the line is ignored by the Python interpreter. For example, in the line `# Display the menu options`, everything following the `#` is a comment. However, hash characters inside of strings, such as `\"Item #1: \"`, are treated as regular text and are not comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing comments:\n",
    "- The `#` character should be followed by a single space to enhance readability.\n",
    "- Comments should explain the purpose or rationale behind the code, not just describe what the code is doing. For instance, `# Get the user's preferences` is more useful than `# Input item1 and item2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Code quality](https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/1-7-comments#sect-00003)\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of code. They are especially useful in delineating sections of code, such as separating menu options from user input handling in a program. Effective use of comments includes:\n",
    "- Using a blank line to separate logical sections of code, enhancing structure and readability.\n",
    "- Writing a comment before each major section of the code; not every line requires a comment, but key operations should be explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Display the menu options\n",
    "print(\"Lunch Menu\")\n",
    "print(\"----------\")\n",
    "print(\"Burrito\")\n",
    "print(\"Enchilada\")\n",
    "print(\"Taco\")\n",
    "print(\"Salad\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the user's preferences\n",
    "item1 = input(\"Item #1: \")\n",
    "item2 = input(\"Item #2: \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code uses comments and spacing to clarify its structure and intent, making it easier for others to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Documentation](https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/1-7-comments#sect-00004)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programs can include documentation called docstrings, which are more verbose than typical comments and are designed to explain what the program or a function does at a higher level. Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes (`\"\"\"`) and can be multiple lines. They typically appear at the beginning of a Python file or function and are used to generate official documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A docstring might include:\n",
    "- A one-line summary of the program or function.\n",
    "- A blank line followed by a more detailed description of the program’s functionality.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Vacations Madlib.\n",
    "This program asks the user for two adjectives and two nouns to print a funny story about a vacation. \n",
